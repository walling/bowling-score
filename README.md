# Bowling Score

This small project is a scoring system for bowling games.

Implementation:

- [ ] A game consists of 10 frames.
- [ ] In general each frame has 2 rolls.
- [ ] In general a player scores the number of pins knocked down.
- [ ] If the player knocks down all 10 pins on the first roll it’s a strike. The player scores 10 plus the number of pins knocked down in the next two rolls.
- [ ] If the player knocks down all 10 pins in two rolls it’s a spare. The player scores 10 plus the number of pins knocked down in the next roll.
- [ ] The player gets additional rolls in the last frame: (optional)
  - [ ] _one_ additional for a spare after the second roll, or
  - [ ] _two_ extra rolls for a strike.
- [ ] Visualize the scoring of the game.
- [ ] Create a method that randomly throws a roll (one roll is 1-10 pins knocked down), and progresses the scoring.
